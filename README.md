# Monty's JavaScript Quiz

## About this
This project was to create a quiz to test a users knowledge on JavaScript. It needed to generate a new question after the user answered and to remove time off of the clock. I took it a step further and created a current tracker of correctly answered questions as well. I also made it so each change to the HTML was done dynamically using JavaScript

### The expectation
The expectation is for the user to answer each question and submit their score which is an aggregate of their number of correct answers and the time remaining on the timer.
